   	  	  		<p>Originally a settlement on the caravan route from Central Asia to China, Shymkent dates back at least to the 12th century and was more than once destroyed by nomad attacks.</p>

   	  	  		<p>Food in Shymkent is amazing. Any restaurant on Tripadvisor won’t let you down but my personal favorites are Madlen, Bar Villa, and Eldorado. You can locate El Dorado at Tauke-Khan 82.</p>

   	  	  		<p>Look for local pickup soccer games at around 1800-1900 when the children get out of school.  They love to practice their English and are very welcoming to foreigners.  Usually, any field near an elementary school will have a game going, don’t be shy to jump in!</p>

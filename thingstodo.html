            Awesome great place. The ticket price was slightly more than 20 (!) tenge, which made me incredibly and pleasantly surprised. But the emotions and impressions can not be estimated in monetary terms. I was there in the late autumn. Very calm and beautiful place. Yellowed leaves of trees on the ground and peace of mind. You can wander and think about your own. Stand on the bridge, enjoy the views. This park is worth visiting.<br>

            An excellent park for walking with children, here is even such a rare opportunity in our city to feed fish, the real ones in the lake! Something reminds me of Tashkent parks, because there is a lake in every park) and of course I like that there is a part with attractions and a part of the park for simple walks. He is especially handsome in the evening<br>

             A large and beautiful monument dedicated to the historical figure. Near the cafe "Panorama" and the park "Independence", a spectacular view of the city. Very good places to walk after after a hard day's work and weekends with children, a park and attractions and catamarans and singing fountains all in one place.<br>

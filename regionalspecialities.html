            It is no coincidence that we put this direction first in the ranking. 
            We think that there is not a single soul who has not visited this recreation area at least once in his life.

    How to get there? Drive towards to Lenger. For those who are afraid to get lost - the signs “Ak Mosque” are placed along the entire route. Drive in the direction of these signs.
     Only 50 km - and you are in a real paradise on Earth. Unless, of course, you perfectly understand the phrase from V. Vysotsky’s poem:
      "Only mountains can be better than mountains.
    " About "no one has been" better silent. Why - read below.

    <P>
          Turkistan is 165km northwest of Skymkent, 320km north of Tashkent and 850km west of Almaty.

It is possible to catch a train from Almaty to Turkestan, which is the option we took. This cost us about US$20 per person for a comfortable 6-person sleeper berth and took 20 hours, leaving Almaty at 22:00.

To leave Turkistan we took a minivan to Taraz, and then changed to another minivan to go to Bishkek. We don’t remember the cost for this sorry, but it was very reasonable.

There is also train access to the capital, Astana, and international connections to Tashkent, if you already have your Uzbekistan visa.
